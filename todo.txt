This text file contains a list of everything that needs to be done before finalising the project

# Page Looks
# These tasks relate to how the page looks and are not too important

  - Add error message for when sign in/out fields are left empty
  - Add success message for when someone logs in to the system successfully

# Pages
# These tasks involve the creation of certain pages and their attributes

  - create framework for staff page
    - staff page must be able to display data from the database
    - staff page must also only be accessible via the login portal, redirect when
      the user has not logged in (i.e. pasting a URL into the search bar)
  - create framework for admin page

# Server
# These tasks involve making the website work with the server

  - authenticate staff login information with that stored on the server
  - get locations from the database on the server and display them in the
    'locations' drop-down selection
  - get names from database using the initials entered in the sign in and out field(s)
  - get the main page to 'talk' to the server and retrieve some information
    from the SQL database

# Security
# These tasks involve the security of the system

  - use password hashing with the staff login information
  - limit attempted login attempts, and add a cool-down function
  - make admin page only accessible via the URL, so that only experienced users,
    such as an admin, have knowledge on how to access the login portal

# URGENT
# These tasks need to be completed as soon as possible

  - allow verified staff to log in to the staff page, currently it will redirect even if the page has been accessed legitimately
    This can be done using a cookie to store whether the user has or has not logged in
