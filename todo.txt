This text file contains a list of everything that needs to be done before finalising the project

# Page Looks
# These tasks relate to how the page looks and are not too important

  - Add error message for when sign in/out fields are left empty
  - Add success message for when someone logs in to the system successfully

# Pages
# These tasks involve the creation of certain pages and their attributes

  - create framework for staff page
    - staff page must be able to display data from the database
    - staff page must also only be accessible via the login portal, redirect when
      the user has not logged in (i.e. pasting a URL into the search bar)
  - create framework for admin page
  - Link staff sign in system to the database
  - Timeouts
    - if a staff member has been idle for more than X minutes (which can be set by the admin),
      It will automatically log them out and send them to the home page

# Server
# These tasks involve making the website work with the server

  - authenticate staff login information with that stored on the server
  - get locations from the database on the server and display them in the
    'locations' drop-down selection
  - get names from database using the initials entered in the sign in and out field(s)
  - get the main page to 'talk' to the server and retrieve some information
    from the SQL database

# Security
# These tasks involve the security of the system

  - use password hashing with the staff login information
  - limit attempted login attempts, and add a cool-down function
  - make admin page inaccessible to non-admins using the access level function
    from the 'pages' section
    - This can be done by recycling code from the staff page PHP code
  - Preventing SQL injection attacks by cleansing data inputs

# URGENT
# These tasks need to be completed as soon as possible
