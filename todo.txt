This text file contains a list of everything that needs to be done before finalising the project

# Page Looks
# These tasks relate to how the page looks and are not too important

  - Add error message for when sign in/out fields are left empty
  - Add success message for when someone logs in to the system successfully

# Pages
# These tasks involve the creation of certain pages and their attributes

  - Timeouts
    - if a staff member has been idle for more than X minutes (which can be set by the admin),
      It will automatically log them out and send them to the home page

  - In administrator edit sections add data cleansing, i.e making sure that names are capitalized before being added to the database

# Server
# These tasks involve making the website work with the server

  - Ensure that all communications with the database save and retrieve the correct data
    - e.g when an integer is being added, ensure that it is not saved as a string

# Security
# These tasks involve the security of the system

  - limit attempted login attempts, and add a cool-down function
  - Preventing SQL injection attacks by cleansing data inputs

# URGENT
# These tasks need to be completed as soon as possible
